# ToneLib Scraper

**ToneLib Scraper** is a command-line tool for downloading guitar effects pedal patches from ToneLib forums.
It requires Python 3.0+, Selenium, and Geckodriver.

## Usage

Run `pip install selenium` before running the script.
You should also download the latest Geckodriver executable and put it in the same directory with `tonelib_scraper.py`.
Execute the script by running `python3 tonelib_scraper.py -u <yourUsername> -p <yourPassword> -e <yourPedalModel>`.
All of the arguments are required for the script to run.
By default, it will create a new folder in scripts directory and store downloaded files in there.
